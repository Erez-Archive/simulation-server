This is the server application which corresponds to the "my-simulation" repository.
Note: this is just a basic app, which is meant for playing around with Binance API. 
If you wish to use this basic app as a basis to anything else, you will need to add a file named: bOverheadData.js in the main folder.
the file should contain your binance key and secret as follows:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  APIKEY: '<your key>', APISECRET: '<your secret>'
};
```
  
**_MAKE SURE TO ADD THAT FILE TO GIT IGNORE!_**
